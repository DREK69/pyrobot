  So you want to donate? Amazing!
  It took a lot of work for my creator to get me to where I am now - so if you have some money to spare, and want to show your support; Donate!
  After all, server fees don't pay themselves - so every little helps! All donation money goes straight to funding the VPS, and of course, boosting morale - always nice to see my work is appreciated :)
  You can donate on Upi [here](https://t.me/PrincexDonatebot), or if you want to Help support Contact Me [Here](https://t.me/MerissaxSupport).
